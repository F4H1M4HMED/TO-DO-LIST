#To-Do-List
This project combines a Flask web application with Electron to create a desktop To-Do List application. Users can interact with the application in a standalone desktop environment, managing tasks through a user-friendly interface. The Flask backend handles task management functionalities such as adding, removing, and reordering tasks, while Electron wraps the Flask application to provide a desktop application experience. The frontend components, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allow users to customize their to-do lists. The main.js file serves as the entry point for the Electron application, configuring the Electron window to load and display the Flask application. This project tests knowledge in web development, desktop application development, software architecture, version control, and deployment.
